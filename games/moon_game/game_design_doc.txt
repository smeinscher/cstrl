Original Pitch
The year is 1999 - 30 years after the US landed on the moon, the world is in chaos. 6 space agencies took to the skies, to escape the turmoil on Earth.
The goal of each agency is to create a colony on the moon - and no one is to be trusted, even former allies.
Nuclear war is imminent on Earth. Will humanity find peace and prosperity on the Moon, or will the chaos come there as well?

Random Mechanics
Dynamic world events impact gameplay
Examples:
    . Communist/Fascist revolutions
        - Communist revolution boosts happiness or production or something
        - Fascist revolution boosts military stuff
Basic economic simulation
    . Socialist economics?
    . Local economic/social policies
        - World events can impact consequences of adopting certain policies

Bare minimum design for prototype:
    . Very basic economics (currency based approach)
    . No expansion of new cities
    . No city upgrades
    . Cities produce units when the user selects to build them, unit build cost based on currency
    . Currency naturally increases over time, capturing new cities increases currency influx
    . No air units
    . Unit types:
        - Astronaut - weak, cheap
        - Humvee - average strength, moderate cost
        - Tank - powerful, expensive
    . Basic, stupid AI
        - AI does not simulate an economy - produces units based on a weighted random, determined by elapsed time and size of empire
    . Still needs intuitive and (relatively) good looking user interface
