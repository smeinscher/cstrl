/**
 * The native activity interface provided by <android/native_activity.h>
 * is based on a set of application-provided callbacks that will be called
 * by the Activity's main thread when certain events occur.
 *
 * This means that each one of this callbacks _should_ _not_ block, or they
 * risk having the system force-close the application. This programming
 * model is direct, lightweight, but constraining.
 *
 * The 'threaded_native_app' static library is used to provide a different
 * execution model where the application can implement its own main event
 * loop in a different thread instead. Here's how it works:
 *
 * 1/ The application must provide a function named "android_main()" that
 *    will be called when the activity is created, in a new thread that is
 *    distinct from the activity's main thread.
 *
 * 2/ android_main() receives a pointer to a valid "android_app" structure
 *    that contains references to other important objects, e.g. the
 *    ANativeActivity obejct instance the application is running in.
 *
 * 3/ the "android_app" object holds an ALooper instance that already
 *    listens to two important things:
 *
 *      - activity lifecycle events (e.g. "pause", "resume"). See APP_CMD_XXX
 *        declarations below.
 *
 *      - input events coming from the AInputQueue attached to the activity.
 *
 *    Each of these correspond to an ALooper callback that returns a "data"
 *    value of LOOPER_ID_MAIN and LOOPER_ID_EVENT, respectively.
 *
 *    Your application can use the same ALooper to listen to additionnal
 *    file-descriptors.
 *
 * 4/ Whenever you receive a LOOPER_ID_MAIN event from the ALooper, your
 *    code should call the function android_app_read_cmd() to read the
 *    command value and act upon it. This is normally done by calling
 *    android_app_exec_cmd() directly.
 *
 *    XXX: MAKE THIS STUFF MORE CLEAR !!
 *
 * 5/ Whenever you receive a LOOPER_ID_EVENT event from the ALooper, you
 *    should read one event from the AInputQueue with AInputQueue_getEvent().
 *
 * See the sample named "native-activity" that comes with the NDK with a
 * full usage example.
